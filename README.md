# Grid Game
Grid Game is a basic HTML5 game about rectangles where the player has to survive for as long as they can against enemies in 3 different types of worlds generated by Junction West (https://github.com/Cobalt-II/Junction-West). 

In order to run, simply download the files and install express by ```npm install express```, and then run the game VIA ```node app```. The game runs on localhost:3000.

Here is a clip of a run of Grid Game I played.

Enemies do not start off this strong or fast, they become stronger as the player survives for a longer amount of time. As enemies become stronger they become worth more score. The goal is to survive while gaining the most score as possible.

~~also the menu design is complete shit ik~~
